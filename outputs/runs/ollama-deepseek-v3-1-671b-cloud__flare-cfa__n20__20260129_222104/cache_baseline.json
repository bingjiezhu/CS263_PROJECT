(Hint, let P(A) be the probability of a CEO being fired, P(B) be the probability of a \u201cgood\u201d performance rating, P(B | A) be the likelihood of a \u201cgood\u201d performance rating given that the CEO was fired, and P(A | B) be the likelihood of the CEO being fired given a \u201cgood\u201d performance rating.),CHOICES: A: 1.5%,B: 2.5%,C: 3.0% Answer:",
